Vision:
-Make a virtual seceratary to go over calendar and ask for vision to then put into concrete tasks
-Help tie actual tasks to overall habits
-Track task success rates to be able to make informed decisions based on success rates of tasks


Behaviour flow (how I am going to use it):
-Daily overview
-Weekly/Monthly planning
-quickly add/modify/delete todos
-Consolidate/organize large amounts of todos that build up




We need the terminal goals of the system to align with the best interests of the user but utilize ML to incentivize them to better themselves in one way or another. 
Accountablity? 

ETHICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
