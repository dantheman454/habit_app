Vision:
-Make a virtual seceratary to go over calendar and ask for vision to then put into concrete tasks
-Help tie actual tasks to overall habits
-Track task success rates to be able to make informed decisions based on success rates of tasks

Behaviour flow (how I am going to use it):
-quickly add/modify/delete todos
-Consolidate/organize large amounts of todos that build up
