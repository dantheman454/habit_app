## Habit App Mind Map (Developers)

This hub aligns the docs with the current implementation. It's the quickest path to the right code and concepts. Diagrams use Mermaid; we reference functions/sections instead of line numbers to reduce churn.

### System overview

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph "Client"
    A["Flutter Web UI\napps/web/flutter_app/lib/main.dart"]
    A2["API wrapper\napps/web/flutter_app/lib/api.dart"]
  end
  subgraph "Server"
    B["Express API\napps/server/server.js"]
    B2["MCP Server\napps/server/mcp/mcp_server.js"]
  end
  subgraph "Persistence"
    P[("SQLite (data/app.db)\nTables: todos, events, habits, goals, audit_log, idempotency")]
  end
  subgraph "LLM"
    F[["Ollama local model\nconfigurable (defaults: convo=llama3.2:3b, code=granite-code:8b)"]]
  end

  A --> A2
  A2 -->|"HTTP JSON"| B
  A2 -->|"MCP tools"| B2
  B -->|"CRUD/search/schedule"| P
  B -->|"assistant apply + audit + idempotency"| P
  B -->|"router/propose/repair/summarize"| F
  B2 -->|"tool execution"| P
```

### End-to-end trace (happy path)

```mermaid

  participant UI as "Flutter Web UI"
  participant API as "Express API"
  participant MCP as "MCP Server"
  participant DB as "SQLite data/app.db"
  participant LLM as "Ollama model"

  UI->>API: POST /api/todos (create)
  API->>DB: insert todo
  API-->>UI: {todo}

  UI->>API: GET /api/assistant/message/stream
  API->>LLM: router / propose / summarize

  UI->>MCP: POST /api/mcp/tools/call

### Contents
- [API Surface](./api_surface.md): Endpoints, shapes, errors, and Flutter API coupling.
- [Data Model](./data_model.md): SQLite tables and normalized shapes; recurrence and occurrence semantics; unified schedule.
- [Backend Algorithms](./backend_algorithms.md): Validation, normalization, recurrence, router, proposal/repair, idempotency, auditing.
- [Assistant Chat Mindmap](./assistant_chat_mindmap.md): Prompts, thresholds, parsing, SSE vs POST, chat/auto/plan.
- [Client Architecture](./client_architecture.md): Flutter state flows, assistant UX, search overlay, CRUD.
- [Glossary](./glossary.md): Domain terms aligned with code.

### Constraints and assumptions
- Single-user, single-process server; SQLite in `data/app.db`.
- No auth; Ollama runs locally.
- Strict recurrence policy: recurrence object required on create/update; anchor required when repeating.
- Assistant safety: validation + single repair; no bulk operations.
- Operations executed via MCP tools rather than direct apply/dryrun endpoints.

### Invariants and contracts
- Repeating items track per-day completion via `completedDates`; use `/api/*/:id/occurrence` or `complete_occurrence`.
- Changing repeatingâ†’none clears `completedDates`.
- Times are `HH:MM` or null; dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Assistant operations are executed through MCP tool calls; all actions are audited.
