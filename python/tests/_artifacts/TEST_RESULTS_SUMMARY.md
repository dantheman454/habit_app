### System Prompt Optimization Results
- **Enhanced Prompt**: LLM-optimized with machine-readable constraints
- **Date Context**: Explicit current date '2025-08-06' and tomorrow '2025-08-07'
- **Type Specifications**: Precise formatting rules for integers, booleans, dates
- **Prohibited Patterns**: Explicit examples of invalid formats

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Parser Sensitivity**: Tool format must be exact `key: value` per line
2. **Type Conversion**: Boolean values must be literal "true"/"false"
3. **Date Formatting**: Must be exact YYYY-MM-DD format
4. **Workflow Execution**: Multi-step scenarios test sequential tool calling
