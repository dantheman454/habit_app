-clean up web UI
    *fix sidebar
    *make LLM chat go all the way to the top
    *clean up search results
    *add in loading symbol for chat and make sure it is clean
-look at current LLM setup and update the prompts and query flow
    *make sure it will just respond to a natural language query without making a tool call
    *do two LLM calls; one to determine how to respond then the other to respond (plan response then respond)

-get a todo list app up and running fully and soundly
    *add in time of day and repeating reminders
    *Look into using the thinking mode of the LLM in the best way. Make a router based on complexity? Classify different intents to then route to proper engine
    *add in todo imports from txt files each as a query to the LLM
    *then add in Habit tracking and chatting with thinking and non-thinking version of LLM


    


Long term:
-fork VS Code?
-ask mitchell if I could fine tune models on the dgx (figure out best way to do this)
