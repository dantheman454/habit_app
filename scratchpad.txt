Keep in mind:
-Have full functionality so I can get my actual todos and events in
-Upload pics of whiteboards to get vision into this repo

Actionable:
-clean up web UI
    *add in loading symbol for chat and make sure it is cleaner
-fix search bar
    *make it cleaner functionally and visually
    *have it only show non-complete tasks (have it be based on the toggle in the bottom left)
-get a todo list app up and running fully and soundly
    *add in time of day and repeating reminders
    *Look into using the thinking mode of the LLM in the best way. Make a router based on complexity? Classify different intents to then route to proper engine
    *add in todo imports from txt files each as a query to the LLM
    *then add in Habit tracking and chatting with thinking and non-thinking version of LLM
-look at current LLM setup and update the prompts and query flow
    *make sure it will just respond to a natural language query without making a tool call
    *do two LLM calls; one to determine how to respond then the other to respond (plan response then respond)

 


Long term:
-ask mitchell if I could fine tune models on the dgx (figure out best way to do this)
-kaizen journal integration somehow?
