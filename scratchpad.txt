Keep in mind:
-Have full functionality so I can get my actual todos and events in
-Upload pics of whiteboards to get vision into this repo

Actionable(NO HABITS,GOALS, OR EVENTS until app has same functionality as how I use reminders app currently):
-get a todo list app up and running fully and soundly
    *add in time of day and repeating reminders
    *Make todos UI better
    
-look at current LLM setup and update the prompts and query flow
    *make sure it will just respond to a natural language query without making a tool call
    *do two LLM calls; one to determine how to respond then the other to respond (plan response then respond)
    *Understand if clarification needed -> Route to agent to perform task or ask for clarification
    *Look into using the thinking mode of the LLM in the best way. Make a router based on complexity? Classify different intents to then route to proper engine
    *then add in Habit tracking and chatting with thinking and non-thinking version of LLM

-Update UI based on apple reminders app
    *fix the diffs for operations and have the ability to observe the recent ops in current chat(like in cursor)


Long term:
-Make unit tests once stable version is here
-Look into DBMS (or better system) for connecting habits, goals, todos, and events
-ask mitchell if I could fine tune models on the dgx (figure out best way to do this)
-kaizen journal integration somehow?
