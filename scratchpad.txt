Keep in mind:
-User behaviours
    *current todo list and google calendar usage
    *Daily/Weekly check in 
    *Task allocation/planning
    *Event tracking/planning
    *Habit/Goal Tracking
-Core abstractions/entities (define these)
    *tasks: dishes, homework, 
    *events: class, appointment,
    *habits: gym, pills, meal prepping
    *goals: understand greasy hair, track supplements and food intake

    

Get done asap:    
    -Clean up UI (Look at cursor, google calendar, and apple calendar/reminders for inspiration)
        *make updating/creating tasks and events easier (time and date are a pain right now)
        *update subheader to be cleaner
            >Make sure the scroll wheel (< Today >) switches with the view
        *fix it from being so snappy when deleting todos or going between tabs
        *FOCUS ONLY ON DAILY VIEW!!!!!!!!! (can use Mr Assister to see bigger for now???)
    
    -Delete and remake the unit tests
    -spam flutter analyze until no issues found and functionality is preserved
    -Place work and school schedule in (leave personal on reminders app until I have a solid system for mobile and backups running)

    -have method to be able to do minimal tasks from phone. Remote client that updates locally until connected to server?


Next:
    -Get assistant pipeline working for basic chats about events and tasks (maybe basic functions??)
        *simplify/iron out current pipeline
        *Router -> Chat/Act -> output (have user confirm updates before applying)
        *have buttons for quick routes (daily overview, weekly planning, etc)
    -Modularize main and clean up/optimize the flutter directory??? (if access to GPT-5 again)




    


Long term:
-QTOT
-HRM
-Scratchpad for Mr Assister
-Make unit tests once stable version is here
-ask mitchell if I could fine tune models on the dgx (figure out best way to do this)
-kaizen journal integration somehow?
