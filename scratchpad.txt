MENTAL MODELS ARE THE GRAPHS I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR???

-get a todo list app up and running fully and soundly
    *add in time of day and repeating reminders
    *Look into using the thinking mode of the LLM in the best way. Make a router based on complexity? Classify different intents to then route to proper engine
    *add in todo imports from txt files each as a query to the LLM
    *then add in Habit tracking and chatting with thinking and non-thinking version of LLM
-get a natural language to todo list item creation/deletion/modification
    *Use LLM to deconstruct into subtask(s) with as much detail as possible, one to validate for hallucinations, and then one to make the tool call(s)

for granite models to enable thinking:
{
    "messages": [
        {"role": "control", "content": "thinking"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "How do I get to the airport if my car won't start?"}
    ]
}

-ask mitchell if I could fine tune models on the dgx (figure out best way to do this)
