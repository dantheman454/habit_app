Keep in mind:
-Have full functionality (BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS)so I can get my actual todos and events in
    *if not, MUST have better way to do google calendar and reminders app using notebookLM or something else (not ideal but fallback)

-USE HARMONY TO PROMPT GPT-OSS


Get done Week of 8/17:
    -Have two types of completions for task (completed and skipped)
    -Get fundamental functions of tasks and events working
        *search bar
        *add tasks and events
        *views working properly
    -Clean up UI
        *remove Today and All from sidebar (this functionality is elsewhere already)
        *switch week to start from sunday 
        *make sure no weird wrapping in pills (Day/Week/Month pill is wack right now)
        *fix it from being so snappy when deleting todos or going between tabs
    -Get assistant pipeline working for basic chats about events and tasks (maybe basic functions??)
        *simplify/iron out current pipeline
        *plug in gpt-oss and see how it goes
    -spam flutter analyze until no issues found and functionality is preserved
    -Modularize main and clean up/optimize the flutter directory??? (if access to GPT-5 again)



-get behaviours the app needs to faciliate (use notebookLM for this and make a detailed spec for the application; Frontend, backend, and everything needed to fully make a prototype of this app)
    *First map out current todo list and google calendar usage, then have it be able to facilitate these behaviours asap
    *Daily/Weekly check in 
    *Task allocation/planning
    *Event tracking/planning
    *Habit/Goal Tracking
    


Long term:
-Make unit tests once stable version is here
-Look into DBMS (or better system) for connecting habits, goals, todos, and events
-ask mitchell if I could fine tune models on the dgx (figure out best way to do this)
-kaizen journal integration somehow?
