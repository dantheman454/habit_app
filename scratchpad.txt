-thoroughly test models at E/V/X stages to see what model to use where
-get a todo list up and running
-get a natural language to todo list item creation/deletion/modification
    *Use LLM to deconstruct into subtask(s) with as much detail as possible, one to validate for hallucinations, and then one to make the tool call(s)

-look into how to best use the smallest LLMs on these simple language tasks
-ask mitchell if I could fine tune models on the dgx (figure out best way to do this)
-ask mitchell if we can get gpt-oss big version up and running
