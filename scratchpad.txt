Keep in mind:
-User behaviours
    *current todo list and google calendar usage
    *Daily/Weekly check in 
    *Task allocation/planning
    *Event tracking/planning
    *Habit/Goal Tracking
-Core abstractions/entities (only do habits but do goal and identity based???)
    *task: A distinct action with a well defined completion criteria
        >dishes, homework, 
    *event: a time period where I must be at a specific place
        >classes, appointments, vacations
    *habit: a set of tasks or events that are consistent with identity or goal
        >gym, pills, meal prepping, weed(self medicating)(need to use Huberman's method to make and break habits)
    *goal: goal based habits???
        >understand greasy hair, track supplements and food intake, sobriety for extended period of time??, fix memory issue(s)

    

Get done asap:    
    -Clean up UI 
        *get 'work' context button working
        *Make the tasks subheader have less whitespace
        *make updating/creating tasks and events easier (time and date are a pain right now)
        *get searchbar working
        *fix it from being so snappy when deleting todos or going between tabs

    -Clean up legacy code and unused imports
        >Remove harmony prompting and Qwen specific functionality
        >
    -Delete and remake the unit tests
    -spam flutter analyze until no issues found and functionality is preserved
    -Place work and school schedule in (still keep using gc and reminders until this system is rock solid with regular backups and good UX)

    


Next:
    -Get assistant pipeline working for basic chats about events and tasks (maybe basic functions??)
        *Simplify/solidify pipeline and take out the different model constants
        *Use attention sinks in the context; these models dump attention to the first tokens
        *Make sure context and prompting is solid; Make sure it doesn't get fed same context twice!!!! Track if the context has been put already
        *Choose between normal qwen3 and coder version (leaning towards coding just for accuracy?)
        *have buttons for quick routes (daily overview, weekly planning, etc)
        *Wrap text box and make it display the markdown properly
    -Modularize main and clean up/optimize the flutter directory??? (if access to GPT-5 again)
    -have method to be able to do minimal tasks from phone. Remote client that updates locally until connected to server?



    


Long term:
-Scratchpad for Mr Assister
-ask mitchell if I could fine tune models on the dgx (figure out best way to do this)
-kaizen journal integration somehow?
-QTOT
-HRM
