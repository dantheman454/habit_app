Keep in mind:
-User behaviours
-Core abstractions/entities

8/23:
-get views solid 

Get done by 8/24 night:
    -Get fundamental functions of tasks and events working
        *views working properly
    -Clean up UI 
        *Make sure the scroll wheel (< Today >) switches with the view
        *fix it from being so snappy when deleting todos or going between tabs
        *Look at cursor, google calendar, and apple calendar/reminders for inspiration
    
    
    -Get assistant pipeline working for basic chats about events and tasks (maybe basic functions??)
        *simplify/iron out current pipeline
        *Router -> Chat/Act -> output (have user confirm updates before applying)


    -have method to be able to do minimal tasks from phone. Remote client that updates locally only?

    -spam flutter analyze until no issues found and functionality is preserved
    -Modularize main and clean up/optimize the flutter directory??? (if access to GPT-5 again)



-get behaviours the app needs to faciliate 
    *First map out current todo list and google calendar usage, then have it be able to facilitate these behaviours asap
    *Daily/Weekly check in 
    *Task allocation/planning
    *Event tracking/planning
    *Habit/Goal Tracking
    


Long term:
-QTOT
-HRM
-Scratchpad for Mr Assister
-Make unit tests once stable version is here
-ask mitchell if I could fine tune models on the dgx (figure out best way to do this)
-kaizen journal integration somehow?
