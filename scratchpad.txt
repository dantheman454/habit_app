Keep in mind:
-Have full functionality (BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS)so I can get my actual todos and events in
    *if not, MUST have better way to do google calendar and reminders app using notebookLM or something else (not ideal but fallback)
-MAKE A WIREFRAME FOR SITE ON FIGMA

Get done Week of 8/17:
    -Get fundamental functions of tasks and events working
        *add tasks and events
        *views working properly
    -Clean up UI (CHAT WITH COMET ABOUT THIS AND BRAINSTORM EXACT UPDATES)
        *Fix header to have sections
            >make searchbar smaller 
            >make skip an x in the top right corner for events and tasks
            >clean update Mr Assisters toggle button
        *Make events and tasks visually distinct in all views (also make sure different contexts work in month view)
        *Switch the Day/Week/Month pill and All/Tasks/Events (figure out better way to layout)
        *make sure no weird wrapping in pills (Day/Week/Month pill is wack right now)
        *add in month to top of Month view
        *Fix issue where it breaks if I scroll past the end of the year
        *fix it from being so snappy when deleting todos or going between tabs
        *Look at cursor, google calendar, and apple calendar/reminders for inspiration
    -Make it such that no tasks or events can be set to have no date (default should be today)
    -Get assistant pipeline working for basic chats about events and tasks (maybe basic functions??)
        *simplify/iron out current pipeline
        *plug in qwen-code and update the prompts 
        *use chain prompting with different lens?
    -spam flutter analyze until no issues found and functionality is preserved
    -Modularize main and clean up/optimize the flutter directory??? (if access to GPT-5 again)


Get done before school:
-have method to be able to do minimal tasks from phone. Remote client that updates locally only?


-get behaviours the app needs to faciliate (use notebookLM for this and make a detailed spec for the application; Frontend, backend, and everything needed to fully make a prototype of this app)
    *First map out current todo list and google calendar usage, then have it be able to facilitate these behaviours asap
    *Daily/Weekly check in 
    *Task allocation/planning
    *Event tracking/planning
    *Habit/Goal Tracking
    


Long term:
-QTOT
-HRM
-Scratchpad for Mr Assister
-Make unit tests once stable version is here
-ask mitchell if I could fine tune models on the dgx (figure out best way to do this)
-kaizen journal integration somehow?
